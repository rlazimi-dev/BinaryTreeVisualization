# BinaryTreeVisualization

##  - Running the files
      - Run through command line using:
          `python BinaryTreeMapVisualization.py`
      - Run on PyCharm by opening the cloned repo folder as a PyCharm project

##  - Importing Other Implementations of BinarySearchTreeMap
      - The current visualization program assumes BinarySearchTreeMap class contains a class Node with class variables: left, right, parent, height
      - In case another implementation of BinarySearchTreeMap containing different variable names for Node is used, be sure to update BinarySearchTreeMapVisualization so the correct fields of Node are accessed
